For the finished version of this project, go to [the last branch]().

## Setup

First, go to [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io) and create a account and project.

Find the Private Key `009ce45c-26ec-4b14-aace-2d8b922a900c` and Project ID `d3caa6ab-eb6b-40d9-9a98-e64f2747d1ed` then replace the values with your API keys.

The project has been deleted so those keys won't work anymore.

### `yarn dev`

Install everything with `yarn` then run `yarn dev` to get up and running.
